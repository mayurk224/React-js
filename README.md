# **My React Learning Journey** 🚀⚛️

This repository documents my **journey of learning React from scratch**, following along with tutorials and building small projects. I'm currently using the resources from **YouTube** to get a solid foundation, and though I haven’t finished yet, I’m progressing steadily and aim to complete it soon. This is a space where I experiment with various React concepts, components, and state management as I learn.

## **Why I Chose React?** ⚛️

React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. It’s component-based, which makes the code more reusable and maintainable. As I aim to become proficient in web development, learning React is an essential part of my journey.

## **Challenges Faced So Far** 🤯

- Getting used to JSX syntax felt weird initially.  
- Understanding state management across components took time.  
- Managing re-renders efficiently is still something I’m improving on.
